167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted
Difficulty: Medium

Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

Example 1:
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

Example 2:
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].

Example 3:
Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

Constraints:
- 2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 10^4
- -1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
- numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- -1000 <= target <= 1000
- The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.

Notes:
- Key insight: Use two pointers since the array is sorted.
- Start with left pointer at beginning and right pointer at end.
- If sum is too large, move right pointer left; if too small, move left pointer right.
- Alternative approaches include binary search and hash map, but two pointers is optimal.
- This is a classic two-pointer technique for sorted arrays.
